KaTeX is a cross-browser JavaScript library that displays mathematical notation in web browsers. It puts special emphasis on being fast and easy to use. It was initially developed by Khan Academy, and became one of the top five trending projects on GitHub.

## Group Theory

Burnside's lemma, sometimes also called Burnside's counting theorem, the Cauchy-Frobenius lemma or the orbit-counting theorem.

Let $\wedge$ be a group action of a finite group $G$ on a finite set $X$. Then the number $t$ of orbits of the action is given by the formula.

$$
t=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}|\text{Fix}(g)|
$$

For each integer $n\ge2$, the quotient group $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a cyclic group generated by $1+n\mathbb{Z}$ and so $\color{red}{\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\cong\mathbb{Z}_n}$.
